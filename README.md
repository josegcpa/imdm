# `mridm` - Python data models for MRI applications

## What's the point

This module contains a few helpful and flexible data models which can be easily extended for other applications. Here, I focused on making some (very) specific tests focusing on MRI data. These can be used to test DICOM or SITK-readable images.

## Testing

Test images were collected from:
